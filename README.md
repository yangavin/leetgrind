# LeetGrind

- `main.py` runs the bot and synchronizes the slash commands to the discord server
- `check_leetcode.py` checks everyone's profile and punishes them if their problem solved has not increased by their goal since last check
  - When ran with the `--print` command, it simply prints the results for testing (no real messages or db edits)
